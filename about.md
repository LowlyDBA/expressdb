# About the Author

My name is John McCall, but I often use the handle LowlyDBA on sites like [GitHub](http://github.com/lowlyDBA), [Stack Overflow](https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/45616/lowlydba), and my personal site
[lowlydba.com](http://www.lowlydba.com).

I'm a data engineer and database administrator who has worked for years with companies ranging from
large financial institutions to startup non-profits. My passion is finding ways
to leverage data to create new and efficient possibilities in software that
make the world a better place. I am also the owner of Express Databases, LLC which provides SQL Server based consulting services.

Over my career I have been able to learn so much from the SQL Server community members
who consistently provide free advice, resources, and tools to other data professionals.
This site is my opportunity to create something free and useful for the community as a
thank you.

While almost every conceivable topic on SQL Server has been and continues to becovered in great detail,
an overall resource that addresses the many quirks of SQL Server Express has never existed. There
were fragments of issues and questions scattered around message boards and forums that cover the unique challenges
and limitations of SQL Server Express, but until now
there hasn't been a single place to find most of that information.

My hope is that this open sourced site is useful for anyone using, learning, or weighing options about
SQL Server Express. It is a fascinating and powerful free database engine that has earned
a place of common usage for many software vendors and students. 

If you have any further questions or problems, feel free to [reach out](https://www.lowlydba.com/consulting/) to me personally
or [open an issue](https://github.com/LowlyDBA/expressdb/issues) on Github.
